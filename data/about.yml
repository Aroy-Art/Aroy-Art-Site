          I have a keen eye for detail and this comes in handy when working with electronics, 
          imaging, programming and game design. The software I commonly work with is Godot Engine, 
          Blender and Krita. In programming I am most familiar with Python, Html, CSS and JavaScript.
          I also have some experience with GDscript as well. My dream is to one day work 
          with game design, level design or something similar.

          Ever since I was a kid I have been interested in technology and I took many devices apart. 
          When I was 11 years old I took apart a computer and put it together again. Since then 
          I have built a lot of computers and I have helped a lot of people with their computers 
          and other electronics. I can speak German, Swedish and English.
