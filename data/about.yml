        I have a keen eye for detail and this comes in handy when working with electronics, 
        imaging, programming and game design. The software I commonly work with is Godot Engine, 
        Blender and Krita. In programming I am most familiar with Godotâ€™s GDscript but I am 
        familiar with Python, Html, CSS and JavaScript as well. My dream is to one day work 
        with game design, level design or something similar.

        Ever since I was a kid I have been interested in technology and I took many devices apart. 
        When I was 11 years old I took apart a computer and put it together again. Since then 
        I have built a lot of computers and I have helped a lot of people with their computers 
        and other electronics. For a while I was an active writer on a German Linux wiki. 
        I can speak German, Swedish and English.
