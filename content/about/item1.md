I have a keen eye for detail and this comes in handy when working with electronics, imaging, programming and game design. The software I commonly work with is Blender, Krita, Godot Engine and Unreal Engine. In programming I am most familiar with Godotâ€™s GDscript but I am familiar with Python, Html, CSS and JavaScript as well. My dream is to one day work with game design, level design or something similar.
