Ever since I was a kid I have been interested in technology and I took many devices apart. When I was 11 years old I took apart a computer and put it together again. Since then I have built a lot of computers and I have helped a lot of people with their computers and other electronics. For a while I was an active writer on a German Linux wiki. I can speak German, Swedish and English.
